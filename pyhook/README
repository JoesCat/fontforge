This is the source distribution for the FontForge Python extension. It
presumes that you already have fontforge (configured for Python
scripting) installed on your system. Alternatively it may be built as
a subproject of FontForge, if this distribution is placed in the
"pyhook" subdirectory of the FontForge source distribution.

For help with installation, see the file INSTALL.
